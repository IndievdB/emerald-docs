Welcome to the pokeemerald documentation! This guide will help you understand how Pokemon Emerald works from the source code level.

## What is pokeemerald?

**pokeemerald** is a complete decompilation of Pokemon Emerald for the Game Boy Advance. The [pret](https://github.com/pret) (Pokemon Reverse Engineering Tools) community has reverse-engineered the original game ROM back into human-readable C source code.

The decompiled code:
- **Compiles back** to a byte-perfect match of the original ROM
- **Is fully readable** - variable names, function names, and structure are all meaningful
- **Contains 314 C source files** covering every aspect of the game
- **Is actively maintained** with documentation and improvements

<LearnMore title="Why decompile a game?" summary="Academic and modding purposes">
Decompilation serves several purposes:

1. **Education** - Understanding how professional games are built
2. **Preservation** - Documenting game mechanics for posterity
3. **Modding** - Creating ROM hacks and fan modifications
4. **Research** - Studying game design patterns and optimization techniques

The pokeemerald project is purely academic and does not distribute copyrighted assets.

## Codebase Statistics

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| C Source Files | 314 |
| Header Files | 514 |
| Lines of Code | ~420,000 |
| Maps | 385+ |
| Graphics Assets | 5,700+ |

## Target Audience

This documentation is designed for **intermediate developers** who:
- Know C basics (or can learn as they go)
- Want to understand game architecture
- Are curious about embedded systems / retro game dev
- May want to create ROM hacks

We explain GBA-specific concepts as we encounter them - no prior hardware knowledge required.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation follows the **game's execution flow**:

```
Boot Sequence → Main Loop → Game State (Overworld/Battle/Menu)
```

Each section builds on previous ones:

1. **Game Flow** - How the game starts and runs
2. **GBA Hardware** - The platform it runs on
3. **Overworld** - Field gameplay
4. **Battle System** - Combat mechanics
5. **Pokemon Data** - Data structures
6. **Scripting** - Event system
7. **Save System** - Persistence

## Quick Orientation

Here's a mental model for the codebase:

```
pokeemerald/
├── src/           # 314 C source files (the game logic)
├── include/       # 514 header files (interfaces & constants)
├── data/          # Game data (maps, scripts, trainers)
├── graphics/      # Image assets (sprites, tiles, UI)
├── sound/         # Music and sound effects
└── tools/         # Build utilities
```

The **src/** directory contains most of what you'll study:
- `main.c` - Entry point and main loop
- `overworld.c` - Field gameplay controller
- `battle_main.c` - Battle state machine
- `pokemon.c` - Pokemon data handling
- `script.c` - Event scripting VM
