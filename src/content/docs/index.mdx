## About This Documentation

This site provides a **graduated learning experience** for the [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) codebase - a complete decompilation of Pokemon Emerald into readable C source code.

**What makes this different:**
- **Start high-level** - diagrams and overviews before diving into code
- **Expandable depth** - click "Learn More" sections when you want details
- **Deep dive pages** - comprehensive technical references for complex topics
- **Real code** - all snippets link directly to the source

## Prerequisites

This documentation assumes you have:
- Basic C programming knowledge (pointers, structs, functions)
- Familiarity with general programming concepts
- Some curiosity about how games work

No prior GBA or game development experience needed - we'll explain everything!

## How to Navigate

1. **Start with [Getting Started](/emerald-docs/getting-started/)** for orientation
2. **Follow [Game Flow](/emerald-docs/game-flow/)** to understand the big picture
3. **Explore specific systems** (Overworld, Battle, Pokemon) as needed
4. **Use [Deep Dives](/emerald-docs/deep-dives/callback-pattern/)** for comprehensive coverage
5. **Reference the [Glossary](/emerald-docs/reference/glossary/)** for unfamiliar terms
