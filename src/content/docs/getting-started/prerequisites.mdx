To fully explore the pokeemerald codebase, you'll want to set up a development environment. This page covers what you need.

## Required Knowledge

You should be comfortable with:

- **C programming basics** - variables, functions, structs, pointers
- **Reading code** - following control flow, understanding function calls
- **Command line** - navigating directories, running build commands

<LearnMore title="New to C?" summary="Resources for learning">
If you're coming from another language, here are key C concepts you'll encounter:

- **Pointers** (`*` and `&`) - Direct memory access
- **Structs** - Custom data types grouping related data
- **Macros** (`#define`) - Preprocessor text replacement
- **Bitwise operations** (`&`, `|`, `<<`, `>>`) - Hardware register manipulation

The [Learn C](https://www.learn-c.org/) interactive tutorial is a good starting point.

## Optional: Build Environment

While you can read the code without building it, having a working build environment helps:

### Linux / WSL (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install build-essential binutils-arm-none-eabi gcc-arm-none-eabi \
    libpng-dev gdebi-core git

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald.git
cd pokeemerald

# Build the ROM
make -j$(nproc)
```

### macOS

```bash
# Install Homebrew if needed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install dependencies
brew install libpng arm-none-eabi-gcc

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald.git
cd pokeemerald
make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

### Windows

Windows users should use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and follow the Linux instructions. Native Windows builds are more complex.

<LearnMore title="Build output" summary="What you get after building">
After a successful build, you'll have:

- `pokeemerald.gba` - The compiled ROM (identical to original)
- `pokeemerald.elf` - Debug symbol information
- `pokeemerald.map` - Memory layout

You can run the ROM in any GBA emulator (mGBA recommended).

## Recommended Tools

### Code Navigation

- **VS Code** with C/C++ extension - syntax highlighting, go-to-definition
- **ctags** - Generate tags for function/variable lookup
- **grep/ripgrep** - Search across the codebase

### Debugging & Testing

- **mGBA** - Accurate GBA emulator with debugging features
- **NO$GBA** - Emulator with advanced debugging tools

### Understanding Assembly

Some low-level code remains in assembly. Useful references:
- [GBATEK](https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm) - Comprehensive GBA hardware documentation
- [Tonc](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/) - GBA programming tutorial

## Project Structure Deep Dive

Here's what each directory contains:

| Directory | Contents | Files |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| `src/` | Game logic in C | 314 .c files |
| `include/` | Header files | 514 .h files |
| `include/constants/` | Game constants | Species IDs, move IDs, flags |
| `include/gba/` | Hardware definitions | I/O registers, memory addresses |
| `data/` | Game data | Maps, scripts, trainer data |
| `graphics/` | Visual assets | Sprites, tiles, UI elements |
| `sound/` | Audio | Music (MIDI), sound effects |
| `asm/` | Assembly code | Macros, data definitions |
| `tools/` | Build tools | Graphics converters, etc. |

## Where to Start Reading

If you want to jump straight into code, start here:

1. **`src/main.c`** - The entry point (`AgbMain`)
2. **`include/main.h`** - The `Main` struct definition
3. **`src/overworld.c`** - How field gameplay works

These three files will introduce you to the core patterns used throughout the codebase.

## Next Steps

With your environment ready, let's understand how the game actually runs:

- [Codebase Overview](/getting-started/codebase-overview/) - High-level architecture
- [Game Flow](/game-flow/) - Boot sequence and main loop
